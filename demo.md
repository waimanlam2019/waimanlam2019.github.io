* Browser Cache Deleter

 This tool is written to have external control deletion over browser cache when we don't trust browser's promise to delete cache after closing the browser. Adopted Strategy pattern to facilitate use with different browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and different platforms such as Windows and Mac because they store cache in different location.

 I created this tool for my own use when I found need to reliably clear browser cache automatically (How could you trust the browser to do the job for you when it is important?), it got the job done and later I don't need it anymore so development stopped right there.
