* Browser Cache Deleter

 This tool is written to have external control deletion over browser cache when we don't trust browser's promise to delete cache after closing the browser. Adopted Strategy pattern to facilitate use with different browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and different platforms such as Windows and Mac because they store cache in different location.
